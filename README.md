# Project Name
Project 03â€”Juicy Brick-Breaker

Description

## Implementation
First 8, Comet Trail, rotation on bricks when hit, 3 levels that are point based (I lowered the points needed to go to the next level for the sake of having a shorter recording), made bricks fade in and out when they appear or break, added particles when the ball hits the paddle, added highlights to the paddle and ball, made the ball stretch and change size when it hits (a bit hard to see in the recording) only added background to the start and end menus
